## Purpose
- Facilitating a deepening of learning from project work, the development of self-regulated learning skills,
and the cohering of knowledge across different projects.
- Allowing students to appreciate the value of the
skills and experience gained through project work, and to take ownership of their own skills development.
- Providing a means for students to present their project work to future employers, both for placements and
future careers.

## Notes for testing the API
- The server port has been relocated to 5000 to allow for proper AWS compatability
- Npm install in ePortfolio-frontend: axios, bootstrap, draftjs etc

## Development workflow
  
Typical workflow for the creation of a new feature / altering the codebase:
1. Create issue: Create an issue and assign appropriate tags, project triage and milestones
2. Create branch on github: Create a new remote branch through github
3. Pull branch: Pull this remote branch to your local machine so that the upstream is preconfigured
4. Switch branches: Change to this new branch and make all new changes within it
5. Submit PR: When you are done, submit a PR for this issue, link the issue to the PR, assign someone to review it, and move the item in the project
6. Review: Another member of the team will review these changes
7. Squash merge: If the changes work well, are of a high quality and don't break anything, squash and merge the changes into the main branch
8. Delete old branch: This old branch will now only serve to clutter stuff up. Delete it.
